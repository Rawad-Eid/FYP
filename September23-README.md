For our FYP meeting on September 23, information regarding the gyroglove in regards to function, material, and structure was analyzed in order to decide whether to continue in this domain.
An elaborative article in addition to a word document with important information can be found. Similarly, a soft actuator hand rehabilitation glove was introduced along with two distinct but similar designs (in the two articles), functionality and purpose. It was decided after a discussion among our group that the most practical idea in terms of feasibility and complexity is the soft hand rehabilitation glove.
